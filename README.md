# On a voyag√© pour vous

This project is a part of Udacity's nanodegree program for The fornt end developper track. It's a web app in which you can plan trips, you will recive an image of your destination. This project uses [Geonames Api](http://www.geonames.org/export/web-services.html) to get the coordinates of the city by city name, [Weatherbit Api](https://www.weatherbit.io/) to get the weather forcast for the day of the trip and [Pixabay Api](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/) to get and image of the place.
